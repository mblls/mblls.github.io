I'm a software engineer currently working in Pennsylvania. I have an interest in all things software engineering/computer science (my day-job) and studies of the natural world (debatably everything else). My hope for this blog is to write about things that will make you go "Ahh!" (in an astonished, or at least semi-amused sort of way).

Please email me at <mark>ballasmatthew@gmail.com</mark> with any questions, concerns, or topic recommendations.

Happy learning!

~ Matt
