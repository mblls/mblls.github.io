title: About Matt
---

I'm a software engineer currently working on contract at Google. This blog is mainly a place for me to write about things that I find personally interesting, where I feel like I can share what I've learned in a digestible way for any audience. When I'm not at work I love tinkering on small projects (I'm currently building a chess engine and a 6502 computer). I have an interest in most things, and hope to continue writing about technical and non-technical subjects.

In my free time, my girlfriend and I are out and about hiking, hanging out with friends, and making up story lines for our cat Orion.

Please email me at [mttblls@gmail.com](mttblls@gmail.com) with any questions or concerns. Happy learning!
