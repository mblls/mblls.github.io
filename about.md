My GitHub: [https://github.com/mblls](https://github.com/mblls)

I'm a software engineer currently working on contract at Google. This blog is where I write about things that I find personally interesting, usually with a technical twist, where I feel like I can share what I've learned in a digestible way, intended to be read by any audience. I have an interest in all things computer science (my profession) and studies of the natural world (debatably everything else).

In my free time, you can my girlfriend and I out and about hiking, hanging out with our friends and family, and making up story lines for our cat Orion.

Please email me at <mark>ballasmatthew@gmail.com</mark> with any questions, concerns, or topic recommendations.

Happy learning!

~ Matt
