title: About Matt
---

I'm a software engineer currently working on contract at Google. I have an
interest in all things mathematics, music, philosophy, biology, and, of course,
computer science. When I'm not working you can find me working on any myriad
of projects (currently interested in generative programming and unix/linux
operating systems), or spending time with my partner and our cat Orion
(pictures below!).
